please use the projectBrief.md file as a guide for the project.

I am not trying to make something weird! I want to use patterns and approaches that are tried, tested and true. 

Avoid over complicated solutions - if it seems complicated, back up and consider whether a simpler approach is better.

please don't make changes to design or function if they're not needed (only do if specifically requested) - I worked hard to get it to look like it does!
