# Pleasure Island Restaurant Week Bingo App - Comprehensive Development Roadmap
The big idea here is that we want to build a restaurant week bingo app for a local chamber of commerce. Users should be able to easily log in and scan QR codes at restaurants to collect squares on their bingo cards. When they have different #'s of squares filled in, they are automatically entered into a raffle. Users should be able to login with their email, google, facebook, or apple. 

Raffle entries should be based on number of squares filled in. Every 5 squares filled in should be an entry into the raffle. 

The style of the app should be modern and sleek. We should use a lot of white space and clean lines. We should use a theme color to make certain features of the app pop, without being too distracting. 

We should use a map to display the restaurants. The map should be interactive and allow users to zoom in and out, and pan around. The map should automatically center on the restaurant locations. Map markers should be clickable and display the restaurant name, address, and URL. 

We should use a responsive design that looks good on both mobile and desktop.

Admin users should be able to add, edit, and delete restaurants from the map. They should also be able to add, edit, and delete QR codes for each restaurant. 

Non-admin users should be able to view the map and the list of restaurants, but not add or edit any information. The non-admin view should be simple and easy to understand, and should be contained on a single page. 

The bingo card should be a flexible grid of squares that have the name of the restaurant on them. The specific grid layout should adjust based on the number of restaurants and the screen size. 

When a non-authenticated user visits the site, they should be directed to a landing page with a button to login. Once the user is logged in, there should be a logout button in the navbar. 

## Tools and Frameworks

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with components.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and optimized loading.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive UI development.

### Backend and Database
- **Supabase**: Utilized for the database to store and manage application data like users, restaurants, and visits.
- **Auth0**: Provides comprehensive authentication solutions including social logins, enterprise identity providers, and secure access management.

### Authentication
- **Auth0**: Manages user authentication and authorization, supporting a variety of identity providers.

### Hosting/Deployment
- **Vercel**: For deploying and hosting the Next.js frontend efficiently.
- **Supabase**: Manages backend database functionalities.

### Additional Tools
- **Mapbox**: Embedded for displaying interactive maps to show restaurant locations.
- **QR Code API**: Integrated for generating and validating QR codes needed for the bingo game mechanics.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration
#### Objective: Establish the foundational structure and settings of the project.
1. **Initialize the Next.js Application**
   - Command: `npx create-next-app my-bingo-app`
   - Navigate into the project directory and set up version control with Git.
2. **Integrate Tailwind CSS**
   - Follow the Tailwind CSS installation guide tailored for Next.js to ensure optimal configuration.
3. **Setup Environment for Auth0 and Supabase**
   - Secure API keys and endpoints for both Auth0 and Supabase for later use in the frontend.

### Phase 2: Authentication Setup Using Auth0
#### Objective: Configure robust authentication mechanisms using Auth0.
1. **Setup Auth0**
   - Create an Auth0 account and a new application.
   - Configure domain and client ID in Auth0 and add them to the Next.js environment variables.
2. **Implement Authentication in Frontend**
   - Use the Auth0 React SDK to integrate login/logout functionality.
   - Handle user authentication state using React contexts or hooks.

### Phase 3: User Interface Development
#### Objective: Develop intuitive and responsive interfaces for both the admin dashboard and the main user interface.
1. **Navbar Component**
   - Implement a dynamic navbar that adjusts content based on user authentication state.
   - Include "Logout" button and conditional "Admin Dashboard" access for admin users, based on Auth0 roles.
2. **Admin Dashboard Interface**
   - Design and develop the admin-specific dashboard with React components for managing restaurants and QR codes.
   - Implement routing to different admin pages for restaurant setup and QR code management.
3. **Main User Interface**
   - Develop the Bingo card interface using React state for interactivity.
   - Integrate Mapbox for displaying interactive maps with restaurant markers.

### Phase 4: Database Setup and Integration Using Supabase
#### Objective: Set up a scalable database schema and integrate it with the frontend.
1. **Design Database Schema in Supabase**
   - Define tables for `Users`, `Restaurants`, `Visits`, and `BingoCards`.
   - Establish relationships and permissions in Supabase for data integrity.
2. **Data Fetching and Manipulation**
   - Implement real-time data fetching from Supabase to populate restaurant data and manage visits.

### Phase 5: QR Code Integration
#### Objective: Implement QR code generation and scanning functionalities.
1. **QR Code Generation**
   - Use a third-party QR Code API to generate QR codes for each restaurant, storing them in the Supabase database.
2. **QR Code Scanning**
   - Integrate a QR code scanning library in the React app.
   - Connect scan validations to update user visits and Bingo card status dynamically.

### Phase 6: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
#### Objective: Ensure the app is robust, performant, and ready for deployment.
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Write unit tests for React components using Jest.
   - Conduct end-to-end tests with tools like Cypress.
2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize React component rendering and database interactions.
3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the frontend via Vercel and ensure that the Supabase database is configured for production use.

### Phase 7: Documentation and Launch
#### Objective: Document the system thoroughly and prepare for a successful launch.
1. **User and Admin Documentation**
   - Create detailed documentation covering all functionalities for both regular users and admins.
2. **Marketing and Launch Planning**
   - Develop marketing materials and plan a launch event to promote the app.

## Conclusion
This roadmap provides a clear and detailed path through all phases of developing the Pleasure Island Restaurant Week Bingo App using Auth0 for authentication and Supabase for database management. It ensures a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience, ready for a successful deployment.
